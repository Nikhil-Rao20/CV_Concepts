# Computer Vision Concepts
In this repository, I will be sharing the code related to the LinkedIn posts. This repository will be only related to the Computer Vision domain, you can even see the post in the readme file of each concept folder.

## Post-01 : Histogram of Oriented Gradients
Histogram of Oriented Gradients is a feature descriptor used in object detection and image analysis. It's especially useful for detecting whether the object is present or not and can even find the location of the object. It's primarily used in pedestrian detection and face recognition. I believe that this is a powerful technique to capture the shape and edge information of the objects in images. Detailed explaination in the [repository or visit my LinkedIn post.
